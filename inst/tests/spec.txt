in order to prove that needs_a works under reasonable circumstances,
beyond reasonable doubt;
====================================================================

error messages (report) have to be shown to be fully functional
when given reasonable inputs.

error messages are shown to be triggered when expected (+) and
not triggered when not expected (+), using intermediate variables
so the pattern does not show up in the error messages call.

(+)
pcall is detected invariably.
[traits] + any are true invariably

custom tests must be shown to work for (+) and (-) cases. Assume that
builtins work.

fuzz testing must never throw an error, with a generator for every 
distinct class of object.

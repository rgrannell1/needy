Version 0.3
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Features:
* implemented general trait modifiers; for example '!' and 'list_of_'. This makes
it possible to test for conditions like '!function' and 'list_of_matrix'. Currently
only one trait modifier may be used per trait.
* added a function 'implemented_modifiers' to display the currently 
implemented modifiers.
* added 'arbitrary' and '*' as an alias for the 'any' trait.

Version 0.2
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Features: 
* added a 'functionable' test; tests if the value can be
used by match.fun( ).
* added a 'variadic' test; tests if the function is variadic
* added support for negation traits; "!string", "!unary function" and 
c("!length_one string", "number") are now valid trait specifications.
* added a function 'add_tests' that allows new trait tests to be added to 
the environment containing trait tests.

Bug Fixes: 
* The errors of missing argument 'traits' or 'value' now correctly
says which argument is missing.
* A clearer error is given when arguments are not given to require_a.
